Abstract:

The modern household experiences rising energy costs, while governments face an increase in electricity demand 
which makes energy-efficient management essential. In collaboration with the Derasat think tank in Bahrain, an 
analysis of electricity consumption patterns in a single Bahraini house will be conducted by utilization of an 
optimization technique to study a collected dataset on an hourly basis without the need for complex installations 
such as smart meters. Python is used for data analysis and visualization, providing Derasat organization with a 
scalable and user-friendly solution. Several crucial attributes in the data collection are assessed such as occupancy, 
outdoor temperature, and main appliances energy usage in Microsoft Excel. In addition, findings, and 
recommendations on how to reduce electricity consumption will be examined by comparing the original dataset with 
the optimized dataset. This approach offers a comprehensive insight into peak usage times and possible energysaving opportunities making it a valuable source. Thus, the Derasat research Institute is interested in this study to 
discuss energy efficiency and policy development with energy-related companies and authorities.
